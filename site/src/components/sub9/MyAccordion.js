                        Tally was born out of frustration with expensive form builders and paywalls. Thatâ€™s why we offer Tally for free, as long as you stay within our fair use guidelines. This allows you to collect unlimited answers without the fear of your account being closed. In return, every Tally form includes a â€™Made with Tallyâ€™ badge, helping us grow our community. We understand that some users and teams require advanced features to enhance their forms. Enter Tally Pro. With a fixed price, you can remove our branding, collaborate with team members, fully customize forms, and more.
